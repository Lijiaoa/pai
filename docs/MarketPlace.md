# MarketPlace
MT web portal provides Marketplace for two purposes:<br>
* To help users submit jobs to MT platform. Since MT platform in AP environment, it may not be convenient to connect to it in local environment. We provide several modules to easy the job submission process. Users can select a module based on your workload type and leverage it to do [job submission](./jobSubmission.md).
* To share commonly used examples. We provide some examples for users to refer to. You can look through examples by job names to find one example that may fit your requirement. The source code git address is included in the example description. We will also provide ways to share your own examples in near future.
